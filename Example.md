 Example — For a Kid
Question

“Why did I hear a loud noise outside?”

What you know

You heard a sound

What you don’t know

What caused it

Where it came from

EBCF says:

“Many causes fit this equally well.
I cannot know which one is correct.”

That’s epistemic honesty.

Example — For Researchers
Situation

Multiple models fit the data

Error no longer improves

Assumptions are unstated

EBCF response

Detects non-identifiability

Marks epistemic boundary

Produces a structured report:

where reasoning breaks

which assumptions are stressed

why further progress is impossible

No more pretending convergence means truth.



Core Concepts (Short & Clear)
Observables

Things you actually know or measured.

Assumptions

Things you believe but did not observe.

Task

What you are trying to infer or predict.

The same data can be enough for one task
and insufficient for another.

Identifiability

Whether the task can be solved even in principle.

Epistemic Boundary

The point where:

uncertainty stops decreasing

and knowledge cannot increase without guessing

Adapters — How EBCF Works for Any Domain

EBCF itself is domain-agnostic.

You connect it to your problem by writing a small adapter that tells EBCF:

how uncertainty behaves

when assumptions fail

Adapters do not solve problems.
They only describe knowledge limits.

One-Sentence Summary

EBCF is a system that knows when it does not know —
and refuses to lie about it.

Final Note

If EBCF allows answering → proceed confidently.
If EBCF stops you → that stop is the correct outcome.
