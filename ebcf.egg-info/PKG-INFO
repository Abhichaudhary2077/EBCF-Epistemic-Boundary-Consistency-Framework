# EBCF — Epistemic Boundary & Consistency Framework

> **EBCF answers one question only:**  
> **“Is it honest to answer this question with what we currently know?”**

It does **not** give answers.  
It decides **whether answering is allowed**.

---

## What Does “Epistemic” Mean Here?

In this project, **epistemic** simply means:

> **Related to knowledge — what is known, what is not known,  
> and whether something can be known at all with the given information.**

That’s it.  
No philosophy degree required.

---

## A Very Simple Explanation (For Anyone)

Imagine someone asks you:

> “What is inside this closed box?”

If:
- you can’t see inside  
- you can’t open it  
- you have no sensors  

Then the **honest answer** is:

> “I don’t know.”

That moment — when you stop instead of guessing —  
that is an **epistemic boundary**.

**EBCF is code that detects that moment automatically.**

---

## Why EBCF Exists

Most systems (including AI systems):

- keep answering even when they shouldn’t
- hide uncertainty
- sound confident while guessing

**EBCF exists to prevent that.**

> Uncertainty is not failure.  
> Pretending uncertainty does not exist is failure.

---

## What EBCF Does (Precisely)

EBCF checks four things:

1. **What you know** (observables)
2. **What you assume** (assumptions)
3. **What you are trying to do** (task)
4. **Whether understanding is actually improving**

If uncertainty:
- stops improving **and**
- the task cannot be solved even in principle

➡️ **EBCF stops the system and explains why.**

---

## What EBCF Is NOT

EBCF is **not**:

- ❌ an AI model  
- ❌ a predictor  
- ❌ a solver  
- ❌ a decision-maker  

It does **not** tell you *what* is true.

It tells you whether **claiming truth would be dishonest**.

---

## When Should You Use EBCF?

Use EBCF **before answering** when:

- ❓ Information is incomplete
- ⚠️ Wrong answers are costly
- 🧠 Assumptions are hidden
- 🔬 You care about scientific honesty
- 🤖 You want AI systems to refuse instead of hallucinate

Typical domains:
- medicine
- research
- machine learning
- simulations
- decision systems
- safety-critical logic

---

## When Should You NOT Use EBCF?

Do NOT use EBCF when:

- you just want a guess
- approximation is acceptable
- uncertainty doesn’t matter
- exploration > correctness

EBCF is **strict by design**.

---

## Minimal Usage Example (For Any Python Developer)

"""python
from ebcf import epistemic_check

result = epistemic_check(
    observables=["chest pain", "normal ECG"],
    missing=["blood test"]
)

print(result)


output:
EpistemicResult(
  allowed=False,
  confidence=0.9,
  reason="Non-identifiable under current observables"
)
"""

## Graphical Interface (For Everyone)

EBCF includes a minimal graphical interface for non-technical users.

Run:

```bash
python ebcf_gui.py




📘 Medical Reference Example (Non-Diagnostic)

EBCF includes a reference implementation for medical symptom reasoning, designed to demonstrate how epistemic boundaries arise in real-world decision-making.

Important

This example does not diagnose, does not predict disease, and does not replace medical professionals.
It evaluates whether conclusions are epistemically justified given the information available.

Example: Chest Pain

Chest pain is a common presentation where:

multiple serious and non-serious causes coexist

symptoms alone are often insufficient to distinguish them

false certainty can be dangerous

The reference flow:

collects only directly observable symptoms

forbids disease labels or interpretive conclusions

explicitly surfaces missing clinical information

triggers an epistemic STOP when causes remain indistinguishable

If red-flag indicators are present, the system immediately halts reasoning and advises seeking urgent medical care.

What this example demonstrates

How EBCF separates observations from assumptions

How missing information is made explicit

Where and why epistemic reasoning must stop

Why uncertainty is sometimes irreducible without new data

This example is intentionally conservative and scope-limited.
It exists to show when not to reason, not how to diagnose.

Reuse

The same structure can be adapted to other domains, including:

debugging

scientific experiments

ML evaluation

system modeling

Only the question specification changes — the EBCF core remains the same.
